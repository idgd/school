CS 301 Searching Lists

# Deliverable 1
~~Implement a binary search on a sorted list.~~ - DONE

# Deliverable 2
Implement a hash table.

* Create an empty list that's much larger than the expected number of items
* Create a hash function that gives an index for that item.
* Implement collision solving (move it to next empty slot)
* Search by hashing, which gives us the slot the value should be in. If the slot is empty, it doesn't exist. If it has another value in it, search up the list until it matches or the list ends, in which case it doesn't exist.

This will be implemented using a `HashList` class. Inputs will be integers.

* `HashList(length)` - Creates a new empty `HashList` of the given length
* `hashfunction(item)` - Gives the slot an item should go into
* `put(item)` - Adds item to list; if full, throw error
* `contains(item)` - Returns true if thel given item exists, false otherwise
* `items()` - Returns all items

DONE

# Deliverable 3

~~Explain and justify running times in the `HashList` methods, using best and worst case scenarios.~~ - DONE

# Deliverable 4

~~Explain how to modify the `HashList` class to match a dictionary.~~ - DONE

# Deliverable 5

~~Implement a `sort_list(ulist)` function that sorts the given list using any method.~~ - DONE

# TODO

* ~~Remove all instances of SLICING: slicing is linear time, ruins hashtable's constant runtimes, and makes binary search linear instead of log(n)~~ - DONE
* ~~Implement counting sort more correctly; python doesn't guarantee sorting from dict keys.~~ - DONE
* Implement more sorts
* Implement testing code
